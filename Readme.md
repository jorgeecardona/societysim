Society Simulation
==================

The main objective of this project is to create a vault of social data in order to use it to simulate different aspects of it.

The architecture is not clear yet, most likely it has to include:

 - A way to add new data and related it with societies.
 - A way to create a new simulation, some scripting language is needed for this, either we can use python (or similar) or a complete new language.
 - A way to present and interact with the results.


The idea is to be able to include large scale data, ie: maps, demographics, income, health state, employment, government structure, and more.

Probably the easiest approach is to collect some previous work on simulation of societies and recreate the results.
